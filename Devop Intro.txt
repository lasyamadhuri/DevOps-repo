DEVOP= DEVLOPMENT+OPERATIONS
NOT A SOFTWARE NOR HARDWARE- JUST A METHOD
It's a culture + set of practices + tools that help:
  . Developers
  . Operations
-> Work together, instead  of working in silos(individual)
WITHOUT DEVOPS - SHOULD  HAVE SPECIFIC TEAMS MANUALLY
WITH - ONLY CODE APPLYING BY CODER- REMAINING ALL BY DEVOPS

Real-time-example:
 Building swiggy
 The developer writes code to add "Track My Order"
 Without DevOps: Developer gives code to Ops team ->they manually deploy -> bugs happen ->delays.
 With DevOps: Code is automatically testes and deployed -> customers get updates faster and safety.

DevOps Helps You:
 . Release features faster
 . Fix bugs quickly
 . Automate repetitive tasks(like server)
